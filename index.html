    <h1>Healthy lifestyle</h1>

    <h2>What is a healthy lifestyle?</h2>
    <p>A healthy lifestyle is a way of living your life that helps you feel good physically, mentally and emotionally. This can mean 
        a lot of different things and look a lot of different ways for each unique person. You get to decide what a healthy lifestyle 
        looks like for you, but there are a few things that should be a part of every lifestyle to make it healthy.</p>

    <h3>1. Exercise</h3>
    <p>Exercise is physical activity that enhances or maintains fitness and overall health. Which is performed for various reasons, 
        including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, prevent 
        injuries, hone athletic skills, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many people choose to exercise outdoors where they 
        can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.</p>

    <h3>2. Nutrition</h3>
    <p>Eating well is one of the best ways to look after your health. Many people underestimate the importance of a healthy diet, but 
        proper nutrition can improve everything, from your energy levels to your mental health. It is clinically proven that eating junk 
        food regularly can impact your body and mind, increasing the likelihood of depression and anxiety. According to the British 
        Nutrition Foundation, healthy eating is also crucial to the health of your immune system. Try to make healthy choices wherever 
        possible, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and don't eat mindlessly. Your body and mind will thank you for it.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Sleep</h3>
    <p>Sleep is often one of the first things to suffer when our routines change. Try your best to keep to regular sleep hours and 
        to ensure you're still getting 7-9 hours a night. Getting enough sleep improves your overall health and protects your mental 
        wellbeing. Studies have shown that sleeping well can make you happier, improve your memory, improve your physical fitness and 
        help you maintain a healthy weight. A good night's sleep can also boost your immune system.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Limit screen time</h3>
    <p>Technology is an incredible tool for work, education and play. However, all the ways in which we use technology can result in us 
        staring at screens for most of the day. This can be physically and mentally harmful - the screen itself strains our eyes, and 
        using a computer can affect our posture, while what we consume online can make us feel sad, lonely and angry.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Maintain healthy relationships</h3>
    <p>Many of us are familiar with advice on romantic relationships, but strong friendships are just as important as the bond with our 
        intimate partners. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), loneliness is a contributing factor in 
        several serious health conditions for adults 50 years of age and older, including heart disease, stroke, depression and dementia. 
        Maintaining a big community throughout our lives can help us combat loneliness and keep us healthy. But like most things, it can 
        take some practice.</p>
